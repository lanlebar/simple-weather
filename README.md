Yet another simple web app I had to build for school

Simple weather app using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). 
- Functionality to save cities (saves to local storage)
- Guess weather game. 
    - Randomly generates a city (from Slovenia, Europe, entire world or from my cities list)
    - Displays current weather condition (depending on the difficulty level)
    - User guesses degrees in the city - either in °C or °F
    - Help button - higher or lower than inputted
